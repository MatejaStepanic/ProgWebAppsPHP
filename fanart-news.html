	<h2>WINTER WONDERLAND COMMUNITY ROUND-UP: TREAT YOURSELF TO AN AVALANCHE OF FAN ART</h2>
	
	<p>We wouldn’t normally instruct anyone to “treat” themselves to an avalanche, but if it comes in the form of Overwatch fan art from the new Winter Wonderland event, bring it on! (Also, we’re based in Irvine, California, so we don’t know what an “avalanche” is but they sound pretty exciting.)Here are some of our favorite pieces of fan art we’ve seen so far: We’ll start things off with a piece by Twitter user @nununumunu depicting Ice Fisherman Roadhog making friends (?) with some adorable seals….</p>
	<p>Introducing the Dad Starter Pack, Winter Edition, drawn by @art_cerealex: ugly sweater plus hot cocoa! (The shoulder pouches just contain more cocoa packets.)</p>
	<p>We imagine the exchange @jaopicksart drew would go something like this: “Who are you?” “I’m you but stronger.”</p>
	<p>As seen in this piece by @mohu_yu288, it looks like Zenyatta has a lot more to teach Genji than just how to live as a cyborg….</p>
	<p>Thank you for giving us the gift of your art this winter! We look forward to celebrating with you during the Winter Wonderland event, which runs until January 2nd.</p>
	<p>When searching for gifts for his family two holiday seasons ago, Morten Skaalvik turned to a celebrated classic: the Ugly Winter Sweater. Skaalvik, a concept artist on the Overwatch team, ended up buying his entire family sweaters based on their favorite TV shows. So when it came time to design Soldier 76’s new Winter Wonderland skin, “Ugly Sweater: 76,” Skaalvik was ready. He’d been training for this moment for years.</p>
	<p>“I remember seeing someone from the community changing Soldier 76’s grumpy Halloween spray into a grumpy ugly Christmas sweater,” Skaalvik recalls during our interview. “And it was just such a perfect fit for him. It fits his dad persona so well while still being fun and wholesome. When I got the task to design a winter epic skin for Soldier 76, I knew the stars had aligned, and the time for Ugly Sweater: 76 had finally arrived.”</p>
	<p>Over the three years Skaalvik has been an artist on the Overwatch team, he has created many of the game’s beloved skins, including Cultist Zenyatta and the legendary Snow Owl Ana from last year’s Winter Wonderland event.“I’m originally from Norway,” says Skaalvik, “so I love designing winter skins where I can channel some of my memories of cold, snowy winters from my childhood.” Like the perfectly ugly sweaters Skaalvik found for his family and the lovingly crafted skins he contributed to Overwatch, Skaalvik has also put a lot of thought and care into Jack Morrison’s sweater. He draws our attention to the bottom of the sweater, which is patterned with little Helix Rocket symbols.</p>
