		<h1>REVVING UP THE ENGINE—OVERWATCH 2 “EVOLVING THE ART” PANEL RECAP</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>At BlizzCon 2019, we presented a first look at the sequel to Overwatch. With improved visuals, technology, and immersive storytelling, Overwatch 2 is set to build upon the foundation created by the original game and bring the world and its heroes to life like never before. Senior Art Director Bill Petras, Assistant Art Director Arnold Tsang, and Technical Director John Lafleur were on stage to share insight about the team’s work.  </p>
		<p>Advancing Our Heroes
		The team had to balance their desire to give the series a revised appearance with the importance of keeping the original spirit of Overwatch’s iconic heroes. Each hero’s redesign is different, but the team's approached them all with a common desire to stay true to their individual stories. Arnold Tsang dove deep into Tracer’s redesign to provide insight on how they gave Overwatch’s postergirl a look that’s fresh, but familiar.</p>
		<p>The team sought to preserve Tracer’s core design elements—her color palette, silhouette, and sense of motion—while simultaneously evolving and updating her model and style. This led to a departure from her “retro” goggles, bomber jacket, and leggings and a move toward a sleeker, more tech-y design that befits a freshly recalled Overwatch agent.</p>
		<p>Evolutions to the game’s technology, like new shaders and lighting, gave the Overwatch team a greater ability to render characters in fine detail, letting them express more emotion through facial features and body language. This enables more intimate, engaging storytelling and allows players to get up close and personal to their favorite heroes in ways they’ve never been able to. With each design tweak—like Bastion’s borrowed hat, or Tracer’s revamped tech—the team made art choices to serve storytelling, implying where our heroes have traveled or who they’ve spent time with between games.</p>
